# bars

A minimal horizontal bar chart creator, as a SvelteKit component.

To use this in a SvelteKit project, tailwind must be used in the consuming project, so that the tailwind CSS normalization is applied.

Here it is in action.

![A title saying 'GOODNESS OF BARS' at the top. Two horizontal bars appear below, labeled "Chance" and "Kendrick" with the values 80 and 100 respectively, and widths to match. A plus icon is clicked, and a new entry appears below. The text "RTJ" is entered, and the value of the bar gradually increased to eclipse the others. Then the other bars are removed with keyboard navigation. The styling on the page is clean and minimal.](static/good-bars.gif)
